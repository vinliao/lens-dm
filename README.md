WARNING: Pre-alpha software, chats are still unencrypted. Don't send sensitive stuff with this (yet)!

Welcome to lens-dm! This is a proof-of-concept for a chat app leveraging the [Lens protocol](https://lens.xyz). The v0.1 of this is very naive and unsophisticated: unencrypted DM stored in Postgres. This definitely can be better, safer, and faster.

Comments, suggestions? Ping me on Twitter: [@pixelhacks](https://twitter.com/pixelhacks). Or, chat with this temporary link: [https://lens-dm.vercel.app/0xb7254cE5Cb61f69b3Fc120b85F0f6b90d871036c](https://lens-dm.vercel.app/0xb7254cE5Cb61f69b3Fc120b85F0f6b90d871036c)
